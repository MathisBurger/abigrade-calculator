# ABI-grade calculator

A simple webapp that can be used to calculate your a levels grade in germany.
It is built with Next.js and Material UI. Currently, it only supports the calculation
for Schleswig-Holstein, but other provinces will follow if there is a need to implement them.

## How to use it

There will not be any need of hosting this application yourself, because 
there is a [public instance](https://mathisburger.github.io/abigrade-calculator/) you can use on your own.
If you want to host it yourself, you just need to clone the repository and build all artifacts. After that you can throw 
it on a webserver that serves static files.

## Data privacy

This application is hosted on GitHub Pages. Therefore, the data that is collected
is only the data collected by the hosting provider. The application itself do not store any long term data on external servers.
The application only uses the clients computer to store data which means there is no communication with any
server or computer in the internet except the GitHub servers to load the static files to serve the webpage.
